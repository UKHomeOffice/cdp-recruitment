# Pre-reqs to share prior to interview

Hello,

I felt it might be helpful to provide a bit more detail that you can share with prospective candidates prior to interview in addition to the docker test:

Figure how to start up and return a salted hash with the docker image [chrisns/docker-devtest](https://hub.docker.com/r/chrisns/docker-devtest) which I expect them to do and share the salted hash that it generates when successfully executed **prior to booking interview**.

To better set expectations in the interview the candidate will be expected to answer questions on:

- Some low level vanilla javascript language features that apply to both ES5 and the differences in ES6/ES2016 and ES2017
- How to recover from some messes in git
- Docker - in addition to the exercise provided to complete prior
- Testing strategy
- Kubernetes architecture
- A simple coding exercise in a language of the candidates choice, pairing with one our apprentices to demonstrate ability to mentor
- Working within an agile team
